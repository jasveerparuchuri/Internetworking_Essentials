Project30: You are hired as a network engineer for City Network
Solutions, a mid-sized enterprise with a 9-floor office building. Each
floor is equipped with 5 computers, and the organization requires a
well-structured network to ensure efficient communication and
scalability.
Network Design Requirements:
1.
Topology Selection: Design a ring topology for first 3 floors, star
topology for next 5 floors, and mesh topology for remaining floors,
considering performance and fault tolerance.
2.
IP Addressing Scheme: The company has decided to use Class C
private IPv4 addresses for first three floors, Class B private IPv4
addresses for next two floors, and then Class A public IPv4
addresses for remaining floors following a classful addressing
scheme. Allocate IP addresses properly for each floor, ensuring
uniqueness.
3.
Routing Strategy for Inter-Floor Communication &
Connectivity: Recommend a routing approach that is dynamic for
inter-floor communication.
Design how the floors will be connected for seamless inter
department communication.
Suggest the appropriate network devices (e.g., switches,
routers, access points) and their placement.
If using dynamic routing, suggest an appropriate routing
protocol (e.g., RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP) with justification.
If using static routing, define the static routes for efficient data
flow.
Specify the number of default gateways along with IP
addresses.
